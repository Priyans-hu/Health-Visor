# Health-Visor

In today's fast-paced world, people often prioritize other aspects of life over their health. Unfortunately, ignoring potential symptoms can lead to significant health issues down the line. According to Google, India witnesses a staggering number of cancer-related deaths, with breast cancer accounting for approximately 1 lakh deaths, brain tumors for over 25,000 deaths, and skin cancer for nearly 10 lakh cases. One of the primary causes of skin cancer is excessive exposure to harmful UV rays, which is a significant concern in India's scorching summers.

To address these challenges, we introduce Health Visor, a platform that empowers individuals to monitor their health conveniently. By simply entering their symptoms, users can access an initial assessment of their health status. Furthermore, Health Visor enables users to book appointments with doctors who can review their information and provide guidance. We have also developed photo detection models that assist in identifying brain tumors and pneumonia. For brain tumor detection, users can upload their brain MRI scans, while X-rays are required for pneumonia detection.

Our platform includes an app that tracks users' live locations and provides real-time updates on the UV index in their area. Additionally, we maintain a location timeline to help users understand their cumulative exposure to UV rays. Health Visor offers valuable suggestions and precautions to help users protect themselves from harmful UV radiation.

In the realm of breast cancer detection, we have trained a machine learning model. This model takes numerical inputs from users in tabular format and provides them with accurate results.

With Health Visor, we aim to bridge the gap between individuals' busy lives and their health needs. By offering accessible and comprehensive health monitoring solutions, we strive to improve early detection, timely intervention, and ultimately, enhance overall well-being.

The Brain Tumour model was quite large, so it can't be uploaded on github.
